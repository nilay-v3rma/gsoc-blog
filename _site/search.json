    "text": "Hello and welcome to my GSoC 2025 blog! I‚Äôm Nilay Verma, a sophomore at IIT Gandhinagar, pursuing a dual major in Computer Science and Materials Science. This summer, I‚Äôm thrilled to be working with MDAnalysis under the Google Summer of Code program.\nMy project, titled ‚ÄúImproving ProLIF‚Äôs 2D interaction visualizations‚Äù, focuses on enhancing the clarity and usability of molecular interaction plots generated by ProLIF. This includes automating residue placement in LigNetwork plots to make them readable out-of-the-box, and possibly introducing new visualization styles like interaction-aware heatmaps or integration with tools like InteractionDrawer and Flareplot.\nThroughout the summer, I‚Äôll be documenting my weekly progress, learnings, challenges, and breakthroughs here. If you‚Äôre curious about data visualization in cheminformatics, molecular interactions, or open-source scientific software, I hope you‚Äôll find something of interest!\nStay tuned for weekly updates and behind-the-scenes looks into the project!\nüß™ Nilay\n\nCheck out my project abstract or follow me on GitHub to see the code in action!"
