Hey everyone! 👋

Welcome to the **Week 4** update of my GSoC journey. This week marked the transition from reading and preparing into **actively writing code**, and I made good progress on interaction-driven layout logic for protein residues.

## 📝 PR Status

To start with, I raised a PR to [**enable exporting LigNetwork data as a NetworkX graph object**](https://github.com/chemosim-lab/ProLIF/pull/274), which is currently under review. This change lays the groundwork for more versatile layout strategies and integration with external graph tools.

The updates discussed below — involving custom coordinate generation for residues — have not been raised as a PR yet. I’m still refining and testing the logic before pushing it upstream.

## 🧠 From Random to Reasoned: Residue Placement

My initial approach used `spring_layout` from NetworkX — a physics-inspired layout algorithm. While it **reduced overlap somewhat**, it lacked awareness of **which residues interacted with which ligand atoms**, leading to **visually entangled diagrams** (see image below):

This made the visualization hard to interpret and missed the goal of contextual clarity.

## 🧭 A Custom, Interaction-Aware Layout

To address this, I implemented a custom layout function that:

- **Analyzes interaction data** between ligand atoms and protein residues.  
- **Calculates direction vectors** from the ligand center to interaction points.  
- **Places residues just outside the ligand**, extending outward from their interaction point.  
- **Handles overlap** by rotating nearby residues around the interaction anchor.  

This results in a layout where **residues surround the ligand more meaningfully**, visually aligned with their interactions and spaced to avoid clutter.

Here’s a glimpse at the core logic:

```python
direction = interaction_point[:2] - ligand_center
direction_unit = direction / np.linalg.norm(direction)
residue_pos = interaction_point[:2] + direction_unit * base_offset_distance
```
Fallback placement uses a radial arrangement to fill in the gaps for residues that don’t have clearly defined interaction points, ensuring no residue is left floating or awkwardly positioned. 

Although this is a backup option for now, the priority is still to make the NetworkX layout options work by providing more information.

## 🔧 Implementation Notes
I also implemented:

- **Ring centroid detection for π interactions:** This helps precisely locate the center of aromatic rings, crucial for accurately positioning residues involved in pi-stacking or T-shaped pi interactions.
- **Overlap resolution logic with rotation around interaction points:** This feature prevents residues from overlapping by rotating them (by 45 degrees clockwise) around their defined interaction points, ensuring a clear and uncluttered visualization.
- **A fallback circular distribution strategy for unpositioned residues:** For residues without clear interaction points, this strategy arranges them in a circular pattern, preventing them from being left out and maintaining a coherent diagram.

With this new layout engine, diagrams are now much clearer and biologically meaningful, setting a solid foundation for the interaction visualization system I’ll continue to build.

## 📆 What’s Next?
Next week, I’ll be focusing on improving NetworkX-based layouts by incorporating interaction-aware edge weights and metadata. I’ll also begin integrating the new coordinate system into the LigNetwork rendering pipeline.
