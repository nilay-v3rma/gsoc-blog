Hello and welcome to my GSoC 2025 blog! I'm **Nilay Verma**, a sophomore at **IIT Gandhinagar**, pursuing a dual major in **Computer Science and Materials Science**. This summer, I'm thrilled to be working with **MDAnalysis** under the **Google Summer of Code** program.

My project, titled *"Improving ProLIFâ€™s 2D interaction visualizations"*, focuses on enhancing the clarity and usability of molecular interaction plots generated by **ProLIF**. This includes automating residue placement in LigNetwork plots to make them readable out-of-the-box, and possibly introducing new visualization styles like interaction-aware heatmaps or integration with tools like **InteractionDrawer** and **Flareplot**.

Throughout the summer, I'll be documenting my weekly progress, learnings, challenges, and breakthroughs here. If youâ€™re curious about data visualization in cheminformatics, molecular interactions, or open-source scientific software, I hope youâ€™ll find something of interest!

Stay tuned for weekly updates and behind-the-scenes looks into the project!

ðŸ§ª Nilay
