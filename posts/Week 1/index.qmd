Hi everyone! 👋

Week 1 of the **Community Bonding Period** has been super exciting and productive. Here’s a quick overview of what I’ve been up to as I start my Google Summer of Code journey with [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) and [ProLIF](https://prolif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!

### 🧑‍💻 Meeting My Mentors

I had my **first video call with both of my mentors – [Cédric Bouysset](https://cedric.bouysset.net/) (ProLIF author) and [Valerij Talagayev](https://talagayev.github.io)**. It was great getting to know them, discussing our expectations, and planning the early roadmap for the project. They were incredibly supportive and offered great insights on how to approach the initial stages.

### 🛠️ Setting Up My Blog & Portfolio

This week, I also:

- Set up this blog using **Quarto** (you’re reading it now! 😄)
- Published my personal portfolio using **Jekyll/Al-Folio** – feel free to check it out [here](https://nilay-v3rma.github.io)!

### ✅ Project Management & Planning

To stay on top of things, We created a **public GitHub Project board** to manage my GSoC tasks and track progress:

### 📚 Diving into ProLIF

I spent time reading through the **[ProLIF](https://prolif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** to build a solid understanding of the library’s core functionality and how interaction visualizations currently work. This will be critical in the coming weeks as I start implementing enhancements.

### 🔧 First Coding Task!

As part of the setup, I completed a small refactoring task:  
🔹 **Separated the JS code from `plotting/network.py` into a new file `plotting/network.js`**. This helps modularize the codebase and makes it easier to maintain the JS components separately. [Link to the PR](https://github.com/chemosim-lab/ProLIF/pull/268)

### 👥 Contributor Sync-Up

We had a **joint meeting with my mentors and [Stuart](https://yuyuan871111.github.io/)**, another GSoC contributor who's also working on ProLIF (on a different project). It was really nice to connect, share our backgrounds, and align on some shared tools and practices. Looking forward to collaborating more in the future!

That’s a wrap for Week 1! 🌀  
Next week, I’ll be diving deeper into the visualization backend and start prototyping initial ideas for the 2D interaction views.

Stay tuned!
